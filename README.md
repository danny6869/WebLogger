# WebLogger

## Description

WebLogger is a plugin created originally for SlimServer by SlimDevices, and now
for Logitech SqueezeCenter by Logitech.  It can be installed as a plugin for
the server software, and from there, can be used by any devices using that
software.  That includes any devices that stream music/media from SqueezeCenter
including squeezebox devices, software emulators (like softsqueeze), or even
winamp streaming from yourserver/stream.mp3.

The basic use of WebLogger is to output what song you are listening to on your
devices to a website, blog, or just about any internet location.  It is highly
customizeable, but provides many useful templates out of the box.

Because WebLogger can be setup do communicate song information in a variety of
ways, it can be a bit overwhelming to configure for the first time.  If you
have any problems, feel free to email me (Danny Rego) at danny@rego.com.  I'll
help out the best I can.


## Installation

1.  Unzip this package into the plugins directory of your "SqueezeCenter" or "slim server" installation.

2.  Re-start SqueezeCenter so that it re-scans for new plugins.

3.  From the main menu of SqueezeCenter's configuration pages, select your player that you would like to use WebLogger with.

5.  Modify settings, and click "save".

...you're done.
